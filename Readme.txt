# Keylogger with Python

This is a simple keylogger script written in Python using the `pynput` library. It captures and logs keystrokes into a file named `Keylog.txt`.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Install the `pynput` library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   pip install pynput
   ```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Python script `keylogger.py` in your favorite code editor.

3. Run the script by executing it in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```
   python keylogger.py
   ```

4. The keylogger will start running, capturing keystrokes and saving them to a file named `Keylog.txt` in the same directory as the script.

5. To stop the keylogger, press the `Esc` key. The keylogger will terminate, and you can access the logged keystrokes in the `Keylog.txt` file.

## Important Notes

- This keylogger is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Ensure you have proper authorization before using it.

- Be cautious when handling the logged data, as it may contain sensitive information.

- Use this script responsibly and only on systems you have permission to monitor.

- The script does not hide itself, so the presence of the keylogger may be visible to the user.
